        Question:
        When speaking of recursion there are two general styles of programming. Those two types include basic recursion
        and dynamic programing. Basic recursion requires that a function call itself in order to solve smaller sub-queries.
        As useful as this programming technique may be there are a number of glaring issues. Some of those issues include
        the number of calls to the stack, total runtime, and total memory of algorithms following this programming style.
        An improvement to this would be dynamic programing; specifically, top-down memoization. In a top-down approach,
        making use of dynamic programing a developer tries to minimize the number of redundant calculations executed
        making use of a cache. This is a significant improvement to previous implementations of recursion but still requires
        recursive calls that may be memory intensive. One improvement to this is bottom-up dynamic programming. In this
        style of programming developers look to do without recursion and large memory calls by using simple iterators to
        achieve desired results.

        Create a function that finds the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence making use of a bottom-up approach to
        dynamic programing.
