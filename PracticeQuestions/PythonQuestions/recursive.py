        Question:

        starting with an initial number. The breaking condition is if the number is less than or equal to zero.
        In that case, we simply print Zero! If that condition is not met, the function calls itself using the current
        number â€“ 2. We also initialize a list and add a smiley emoji equal to the current number.
